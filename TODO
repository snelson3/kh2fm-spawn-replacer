write scripts to get the msn/ai addresses
add teleport cond
update kh2lib when releasing this

mdlx_offset attribute should be moved into the enemy
    details of this need to be finished, change spawn replacer for this
        also manually handle the double battles
does setting the level of terra to 0 make him not hurt you hard?

xemnas crashes when you beat him in petes world, thats a buzzkill (is it unique? is it cause of camera thing ?)

idk where else to put it but the MSN id shows up in the associated ARD, wtry altering that when trying to load other MSNs from other worlds
    also maybe you could change the world id listed in the ard file
also look at fixing the collision in xigbars room when other enemies are there
another option, there's a bunch of alloc opcodes in the ARDs, maybe write up a script to list those in order and compare to my own list of memory usage
    could end up with a much more fine grained idea of how much memory things take up/how much is available

figure out what about xemnas makes him crash when the fight in pete is done
try to find better demyx fix that doesn't involve disabling revenge
data demyx doesn't die at 1 hp
try to fix lexaeus/etc
because I'm a slut, try to fix hydra real quick when testing things tonight
because I'm a super slut, also look at final xemnas, and mess with pete TR again
I really wish I could get other stuff in riku to work

ban all the guys requiring fixes from the colloseum battles  (also the rando should have a disableCamera: false option important for colosseum, or just if it doesn't have an MSN option don't do it)
need to figure out hades msn tomorrow (hard read for it to be HE19_MS205 but that might not be right)

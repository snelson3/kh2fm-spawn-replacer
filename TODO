make the comments better for fixes (inline comments possible)
write scripts to get the msn/ai addresses
add teleport cond
update kh2lib when releasing this

xemnas crashes when you beat him in petes world, thats a buzzkill

idk where else to put it but the MSN id shows up in the associated ARD, wtry altering that when trying to load other MSNs from other worlds
    also maybe you could change the world id listed in the ard file
also look at fixing the collision in xigbars room when other enemies are there
another option, there's a bunch of alloc opcodes in the ARDs, maybe write up a script to list those in order and compare to my own list of memory usage
    could end up with a much more fine grained idea of how much memory things take up/how much is available
